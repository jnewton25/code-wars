/* ES6 string addition

ES6 has introduced another way of joining strings. Your task is to find out what this is 
and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between 
the two strings.

+ , .concat() & .join() will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also removed some 
other methods that can be used to cheat!

If one of the arguments is a number your code must coerce it into being a string.

function joinStrings(string1, string2){
   return `${string1} ${string2}`
}
