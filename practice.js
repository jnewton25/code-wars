/* Even or Odd
Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns"Even" for even
numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

function evenOrOdd(number) {
  if (number % 2 === 0) {
    return "Even";
  } else {
    return "Odd";
  }
}
*/

/* Opposites Attract
Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, 
they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers 
has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals 
it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and 
return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
  if (flower1 % 2 === 0 && flower2 % 2 === 1 || flower1 % 2 === 1 && flower2 % 2 === 0) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
*/

/* Sum Mixed Array
Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, return the sum of the array values 
as if all were numbers.

Return your answer as a number.

function sumMix(x){
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
    count += Number(x[i]);
  }
  return count;
}
